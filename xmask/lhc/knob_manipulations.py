    This is basically Eq. (59) in https://cds.cern.ch/record/522049/files/lhc-project-report-501.pdf ,
    with cosine for the real part and sine for the imaginary part.

    What is happening here is, that we are building a matrix for the equation-system

    M * [MQS12,..., MQS81] = -[RE, IM]

    where RE and IM are the real and imaginary parts of the coupling coefficients, 
    and therefore the knobs we want to create.
    MQS12 - MQS81 is the total powering of the MQS per arc, which we steer with 
    the knob. All MQS in a single arc are assumed to be powered equally.

    After building the matrix, we "solve" the equation system via pseudo-inverese M+
    and get therefore the definition of the coupling knob.

    [MQS12,..., MQS81] = - M+ * [RE, IM]

    HINT: The MINN function in corr_MB_ats_v4 is simply the calculation the pseudo-inverse:
    M+  = M' (M * M')^-1  (' = transpose, ^-1 = inverse)
    including the minus on the rhs of the equation.


    TODO:
        - Get beta and phases from the beamline directly (instead of the TFS dataframe)
        - Make the number of MQS more flexible, could maybe be parsed from the beamline
        - Why is there an absolute value in Eq. (59) but not in the code? (see also https://cds.cern.ch/record/2778887/files/CERN-ACC-NOTE-2021-0022.pdf)
        - Add a2 correction to the KQS definition (as in corr_MB_ats_v4)
        - Include the actual fractional tune split of the current machine (see also https://cds.cern.ch/record/2778887/files/CERN-ACC-NOTE-2021-0022.pdf)
        - Calculate also the contribution to f_1010 and try to set to zero

        - Does this still work when slicing the MQS?
